In its determination to preserve the century of revolution, Gale initiated a revolution of its own: digitization of epic proportions to preserve these invaluable works in the largest archive of its kind. Now for the first time these high-quality digital copies of original 18th century manuscripts are available in print, making them highly accessible to libraries, undergraduate students, and independent scholars.The Age of Enlightenment profoundly enriched religious and philosophical understanding and continues to influence present-day thinking. Works collected here include masterpieces by David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as well as religious sermons and moral debates on the issues of the day, such as the slave trade. The Age of Reason saw conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism transformed into one between faith and logic -- a debate that continues in the twenty-first century.++++The below data was compiled from various identification fields in the bibliographic record of this title.

Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.

Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man\\'s Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"1610920322087764759\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent(\\$(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'8_book_4069\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"JLQZ6owIKbzkY3dcd6EVhq6PRFhjt5PFNmMzUeruU4/h972BO8RKPtMj1jizh5y19z/R4z81aqoJ2VxVIPPxCQ==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"4069\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"8_book_4069\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/quotes/tag/success\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"QOgfyYJIHqxY9OFROLKa2IPYsxDtdwyHQnSluuEHEZyFq7uiNYR9Lm+0QDX8lBPr2mgmq7H19eh9zsq+KxqzGg==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"8_book_4069\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"4069\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/quotes/tag/success\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.
